# CommandLineDemo

**CommandLineDemo** demonstrates the use of C# scripts and command-line interaction made possible by the introduction of [dotnet run app.cs](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-run-app/). This repository serves as an educational and reference resource for running `.cs` files directly from the command lineâ€”no explicit `Main` method or project file required.

> **Note:** You must be running [.NET 10 Preview 4](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/10.0) or later to use this feature.

- **No Project File Required:** Scripts run standalone, showcasing the new simplified development workflow.
